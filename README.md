# Introduction
This work presents software stack for indoor Vision-based Quadrupedal Locomotion. It integrates existing technology in Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), global path planning, and composite COG Trajectory planning methods to achieve both autonomous and semi-autonomous Quadrupedal Locomotion. The work is currently tested in simulation with Unitreeâ€™s Alien go Robot and can be extended to reality. Unlike the existing SDK, this software presents all in one solution to locomotion problems, including vision-based foothold planning and obstacle avoidance. The modular architecture of the Software allows various controller implementations

# Building

In order to install the Aliengo Navigation Software stack, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd catkin_workspace/src
    git clone https://github.com/guru-narayana/aliengo_navigation
    cd ..
    catkin_make

# Detail of Packages

## unitree_gazebo:
You can launch the Gazebo simulation of the aliengo robot with the following command:
```
roslaunch unitree_gazebo aliengo_gazebo.launch
```

## aliengo_utils
To launch simulation and RTAB-Map at once use the following
```
roslaunch aliengo_utils  Aliengo_sim.launch
```

And you can use the joystick to plan the footholds by launching
```
roslaunch aliengo_utils foot_planner.py
```
This will only plan the footholds but will not execute them, inorder to execute the plan use the controller node.

# Nodes 
## Quad_controller_node
To launch the controller node you can use the following command.
```
rosrun aliengo_controller quad_controller_node 
```
# Params
All the parameters are located in the aliengo_utils package.
